# Express.JS CRUD App

# ðŸ‘‰Description

   This Express CRUD App serves as a practical example of building a RESTful API using Node.js and Express . It provides users with the ability to create,read,update and delete items in a straightforward manner. The application is designed to be lightweight and easy to understand ,making it an excellent starting point for developers looking to learn about Express and RESTful principles.

### For a CRUD API , you typically need four types of operations:

ðŸ‘‰ Create (POST): Adds new data.

ðŸ‘‰Read(GET): Retrives data.

ðŸ‘‰Update(PUT,PATCH): Modifies existing data.

ðŸ‘‰Delete(DELETE): Removes data.

- Now Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should see â€˜Hello World!â€™ displayed.

# Implementing CRUD Operations
### Create: Adding a New Book
- First, youâ€™ll need to handle JSON data.At the top of your server.js, add:

- And there you have it. Youâ€™ve implemented all the CRUD operations for your book management API.

# Integrating a Database;
- Letâ€™s integrate a database into your application. For this example, letâ€™s use MongoDB.

# Creating a model
